<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

## Introduction:
The objective of this project was to design an electronic voting machine using Proteus software that utilizes biometric data for voter verification. This project aimed to address the issue of voter fraud and ensure that only eligible voters are able to cast their ballots.

## Methodology:
The design of the electronic voting machine was implemented using Proteus software. The Proteus software was used to simulate the circuit and ensure that it functioned as intended. The biometric data used for voter verification was fingerprints. The fingerprints were scanned using a fingerprint sensor and compared to a pre-existing database of fingerprints to verify the voter's identity.

## Design:
The electronic voting machine consisted of a microcontroller, a dummy fingerprint sensor, an LCD display, a voting button, and a 20V to 5V buck converter. The microcontroller was used to control the flow of data and ensure that the voting process was secure. The fingerprint sensor was used to scan the voter's fingerprints and send the data to the microcontroller for verification. The LCD display was used to display messages to the voter, such as "Voter Verified" or "Invalid Voter." The voting button was used to cast the voter's ballot once their identity had been verified.

## Testing:
The electronic voting machine was tested by simulating the voting process using Proteus software. The fingerprints of multiple test voters were scanned and compared to a pre-existing database of fingerprints to verify their identities. The results of the testing indicated that the electronic voting machine was able to accurately verify the identities of voters using their fingerprints.

## Conclusion:
The project was successful in designing an electronic voting machine that utilizes biometric data for voter verification. The use of fingerprints as a form of biometric data was found to be effective in ensuring that only eligible voters were able to cast their ballots. The electronic voting machine designed using Proteus software is secure, accurate, and easy to use. The breakthrough of the project is the usage of biometric data for voter verification, which ensures the voter's identity and prevent voter fraud.
